{- |
The main type class which stores a type level list
describing which exceptions your computation may throw.

Sadly, GHC does not provide us type level sets, so if compiler infers
exceptions in the different order they appear in your type signature
you will get an ugly error message.
You can, however, let GHC infer the type and then copy it into your type signature.

Should be useful with type synonyms for lists of exceptions.

'Handler' stores a type of 'Exception' it handles in its type signature, it allows
to match a list of provided handlers against a list of exceptions possible
inside a computation and throw an error if they do not match.

Catch all exceptions inside a computation.

The list difference.
It is a type error to try to remove an element from the second list
which is not present in the first.

This way you may be sure you aren't ignoring impossible (from your type) errors.
